    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>500g of Potato</li>
      <li>Refined Oil</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h4>Chop the potatoes</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To prepare this easy recipe, you need to make sure that they are cut
            in the right shape and size.
          </li>
          <li>
            They should neither be too thick, nor too thin and should be cut
            clean and sharp.
          </li>
          <li>
            The trick is to first slice the potatoes and then cut them
            lengthwise. You can also use a fries cutter for that long, even
            shape.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <hr>
      <li>
        <h4>Soak cut potatoes in ice-cold water for 10-15 minutes</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Now, wash the potatoes under running water till they are squeaky
            clean.
          </li>
          <li>Place them in a bowl of iced water for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
          <li>Keep them submerged in water or they will turn black.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <hr>
      <li>
        <h4>Deep fry the potato fries</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Now, heat the oil in a deep bottomed pan. Once the smoke starts
            appearing, reduce the flame and allow it to acquire a lower
            temperature.
          </li>
          <li>
            Now, deep fry the potatoes in batches. Keep the flame low. This will
            make them crunchy and also help retain their colour.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <hr>
        <h4>Sprinkle the Salt</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Drain excess oil and place them on an absorbent paper. Allow them to
            cool.
          </li>
          <li>Now sprinkle salt and pepper and toss well.</li>
          <li>
            Serve immediately with ketchup. They can also be served with burgers
            and cutlets.
          </li>
