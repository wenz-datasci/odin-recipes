    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1.5kg of Steak</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of butter</li>
      <li>Lime juice</li>
      <li>Extra-virgin Oil</li>

    </ul>

      Step 1: Food Prep <br />
      The night before you are grilling, prepare your steak marinade and
      chimichurri to refrigerate overnight. <br />
      Place your steak and marinade ingredients in a resealable plastic bag and
      coat your steak. Refrigerate in the resealable bag overnight. <br />
      Then, combine your chimichurri ingredients in a bowl. Mix together and
      refrigerate overnight. <br />
      Just before cooking, season your steak with salt and pepper.

      Step 2: grill Prep <br />
      Fuel: We recommend Kingsford® Original Charcoal Briquets <br />
      Method: Direct-Heat Grilling <br />
      Temp: 400°F (Medium Heat)
    </p>
    <p>
      Step 3: The Cook<br />
      When you are at temp, put cooking oil on a folded paper towel. Grab the
      oiled paper towel with long-handled tongs and oil the grate thoroughly.
      <br />
      Place your steak on the grill and cook to your desired doneness. Brush
      each side with butter and lime juice. The USDA recommends cooking steak
      until it reaches an internal temperature of 145°F on a digital meat
      thermometer. <br />
      Remove your steak from the grill and allow it to rest for 3 minutes. Slice
      your steak against the grain or serve it whole and top it with your
      chimichurri as desired.

      sauce.
